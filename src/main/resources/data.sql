insert into algorithms  (algo_id, algo_name, algo_description) values (1, 'BUBBLE SORT', 'Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm. It simply checks if the adjacent elements are in order (ascending or descending) and swaps otherwise. So, this way, the values keep bubbling to one end of the list/array of integers, depending on the order (the largest elements keep bubbling up the right-side of the list/array if ascending and left-side if descending)');
